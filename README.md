## Masonry

Masonry is an internal library for myself. Inspired by the work of others, built from `styled-system` and `styled-components`

# Masonry Name

My father has a masonry company in Washington, DC.
David Desandro has a masonry javascript library.
I simply think it's a great name when referring to building things.
